<h2>CRYPTOGRAPHY<h2>
<h3>WHAT IS CRYPTOGRAPHY?</h3>
<p>
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries.
Encryption is essentially important because it secures data and information from unauthorized access and thus maintains
 the confidentiality. Hereâ€™s a blog post to help you understand "what is cryptography" and
 how can it be used to protect corporate secrets, secure classified information, and personal information to guard against things like identity theft.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>WHY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>
Cryptography is the study of techniques used for ensuring a secured communication. With the help of cryptography, you can construct protocols
 which will prevent the third parties from reading your private messages. Cryptography is nowadays used in a number of applications
 such as military communications, e-commerce, computer passwords, digital currencies, and so on. 
<br>
Cryptography is also used for spying and hence, it is considered as a weapon in a number of countries.
 In some of the countries, cryptography is used by the investigators to get access to highly confidential 
and private documents which are relevant to an investigation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>FEATURES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY?</h3>

<h3>1.Confidentiality:</h3>
<p>Information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no other person except him can access it.</p>
<h3>2.Integrity:</h3>
<p>Information cannot be modified in storage or transition between sender and intended receiver without any addition to information being detected.</p>
<h3>3.Non-repudiation:</h3>
<p>The creator/sender of information cannot deny his or her intention to send information at later stage.</p>
<h3>4.Authentication:</h3>
<p>The identities of sender and receiver are confirmed. As well as destination/origin of information is confirmed.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>TYPES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY:</h3>
<p>In general there are three types Of cryptography ,let us what are they:</p>
<h3>1.Symmetric Key Cryptography:</h3>
<p>It is an encryption system where the sender and receiver of message use a single common key to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
Symmetric Key Systems are faster and simpler but the problem is that sender and receiver have to somehow exchange key in a secure manner. 
The most popular symmetric key cryptography system is Data Encryption System(DES).</p>
<h3>2.Hash Functions:</h3>
<p>There is no usage of any key in this algorithm.
 A hash value with fixed length is calculated as per the plain text which makes it impossible for contents of plain text to be recovered.
 Many operating systems use hash functions to encrypt passwords.</p>
<h3>3.Asymmetric Key Cryptography:</h3>
<p>Under this system a pair of keys is used to encrypt and decrypt information.
 A public key is used for encryption and a private key is used for decryption. 
Public key and Private Key are different.
 Even if the public key is known by everyone the intended receiver can only decode it because he alone knows the private key</p>
